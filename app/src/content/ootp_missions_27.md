See [OOTP Missions](#ootp-misssions-2) for details on OOTP and the previous app this is based on.

### Current Status

- Deployed OOTP Missions 27 to CraterVar, OOTP Missions 2 (for ootp26) is in archive mode on GitHub Pages
- Updated mission calculation algorithm for a major performance boost, removed greedy mode toggle
- Added Mission Search

### Roadmap

- UI Overhaul
- Find a way to more easily update missions and card updates during the seasion
  - Getting mission data programatically has been tried and failed. The data doesn't seem to be saved on a system file and decrypting api requests with WireShark failed
  - The plan is to try to set up OCR for mission data and continue to manually export card shop data
  - Consider crowdsourcing
