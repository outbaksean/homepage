# Hi, I'm CraterVar

This is my overengineered personal site. Check out the projects section, there's at least one working app and some ideas for more.

I'm a programmer, into video games, magic the gathering, and watching sports. I might write about those topics but will mainly be describing my programming work. I use AI a lot for coding, not at all for writing.
