# Ideas

## Paint to SVG

An AI backed app to turn images done in paint into svg files that can be used in projects. There are plenty of apps that do this now, but after briefly trying some they don't do it exactly how I want.

## Hex Game

I've played around with making a 2d hex based game multiple times using godot and html canvas. I'd like to make this a real thing eventually.

## ThreeJS Game

I want to learn about 3JS, probably by trying to make an isometric rpg

## AI Claw

A Claw is an AI harness that has a channel for the user to message it and can schedule AI tasks or run them on demand. I like the idea of making my own claw, deployed on my minipc server running a local model with Discord as a chat channel to help manage my media library.
