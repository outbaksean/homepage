# Weekend of 2/28/2026 - OCR Work and thoughts on Claw

- I mostly worked on ootp-mission-27 to do OCR to getting missions from the game. This isn't done but I made good progress. I'm hoping when ootp27 releasees I'll have it down to less than an hour or two to get all missions ouptut. This depends on me getting my current work in a good place (currently working in a branch) and the OOTP27 release to not have major changes to mission structurei or ui.
- Details on OCR work to be done later. See [branch](https://github.com/outbaksean/ootp-missions-27/tree/feat/windows-media-ocr) for progress. Readme isn't up to date but I'll update when I've got something working. The plan is to update all OOTP26 missions as a test of the flow. Latest Updates October 9 2025.  Currently missing "Playoff Moments" and later.
- Asked google about a local claw implementation, copied output below (I know the format is wrong, looking at it):

- To get Claude Code to build this securely, you need to provide the architectural "guardrails" upfront. If you just ask for a "Discord bot that runs Ollama," it might write naive code that lacks the Task Queue or User ID locking necessary for a Mini-PC.
Use the prompt below. It is designed to produce a professional C# .NET 9 implementation that respects your hardware limits and security concerns.
The "Secure Claw" Master Prompt

    "Act as a Senior .NET Platform Engineer. Build a C# worker service called 'ClawAgent' that will run in a Proxmox LXC on an Intel Mini-PC.
    Core Requirements:

        Messaging: Use Discord.Net to create a bot.
        Security: Hard-code a ulong TargetUserId constant. The bot must ignore all messages (including !task commands) unless they originate from this specific ID.
        Task Queue: Implement a System.Threading.Channels queue. Because this runs on a Mini-PC iGPU, only one task should be processed at a time.
        Inference: The worker must poll the queue and send requests to a local Ollama instance (http://localhost:11434/api/generate) using HttpClient. Use the qwen2.5-coder:7b model.
        Tooling: Include a 'MediaScanner' module that can safely list files in a specific directory (passed as an environment variable) to provide context to the AI.
        Resilience: Use a BackgroundService pattern so the bot remains responsive on Discord while the iGPU is pinned during a long 'thinking' task.

    Safety Constraints:

        Do NOT use Process.Start or any shell execution.
        All file access must be restricted to the designated media path.
        Provide a README.md with the specific Proxmox Firewall rules needed to allow full Internet access (WAN) while blocking all local network traffic (LAN)."

Why this prompt works for your setup:

    Channels over Lists: Using System.Threading.Channels is the "pro" way to handle the iGPU bottleneck. It ensures that if you send 5 tasks from your phone, they queue up neatly instead of trying to run 5 Ollama instances at once and crashing your Proxmox node.
    The "TargetUserId" Guard: This is your primary defense against your bot being "hijacked" by someone else on Discord.
    Separation of Concerns: By asking for a BackgroundService, you ensure the Discord "Heartbeat" doesn't time out while the Intel iGPU is 100% utilized for 5 minutes.

How to execute this in Claude Code:

    Create a new directory: mkdir ClawAgent && cd ClawAgent.
    Run: claude.
    Paste the prompt above.
    Once it generates the files, run dotnet run to test locally on your main PC (using a test Discord token) before moving it to the Proxmox LXC.

Would you like me to provide the specific iptables or Proxmox GUI steps to verify the "WAN-only" firewall rule once the code is ready?
